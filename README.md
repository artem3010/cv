# CV Generator

CV Generator is a web service that allows you to create professional resumes in PDF format. Previously, I stored my resumes only locally in PDF format, but now this service enables dynamic generation and storage.

## Features

- Create resumes in PDF format
- Download and share resumes easily

## How to Run

### Using Docker

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh

   ```

2. Start the service using Docker Compose:
   ```sh

   ```

3. The service will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.
